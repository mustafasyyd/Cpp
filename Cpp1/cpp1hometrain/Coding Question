# global variable out of main vs local variable inside main
        
        //EXPLAIN:
            (Defining and initializing two variables with the same name,
             one out of main and the other inside it.
             THEN, printing with name.)

        //RESULT:
            (Printed succ. without error of the existence of two variable with same name,
             but printed the inside variable.)
